# Game concept
Picture this. 

You're the cute himalayan cat shown above born and raised in the himalayan mountains.

You know it won't be easy, with at least 3 trials of increasing difficulty you have to pass to take home the goal. But you're brave, and are going to give it your best shot.

**Come back on 5/15/2024 to play and compete for the #1 gold medal!**
